description: |
  ZooKeeper is a centralized, reliable, service for maintaining
  configuration information, naming, providing distributed
  synchronization, and group services. All of these kinds of services
  are used in some form or another by distributed applications.  This
  package contains the shell scripts and an example configuration but
  does not automatically start up the service. The example configuration
  is installed with the update-alternatives mechanism.
